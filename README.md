Image-to-text Model:
1. Transfer learning from donut-model, which is a new OCR-free approach.
2. Using the CORD dataset to train model on indonesian receipt
3. Using the pytorch framework
4. the model takes an image input and output the item's name, quantity, price, and total price

How to use the repo:
1. Fork the repo
2. To use the Image-to-text Model:
   - Change the hugginface repo (to store the model)
   - Run the notebook to train the model on CORD dataset
